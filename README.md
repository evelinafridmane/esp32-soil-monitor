# Soil Monitor

An ESP32-C3 + MicroPython soil moisture monitor for houseplants, with a
Python backend for long-term storage and a web dashboard.

## What it does

- Reads soil moisture from a capacitive sensor on an ESP32-C3 Super Mini.
- Drives an RGBW status LED so moisture level is visible at a glance
  (red = dry, yellow = getting dry, green = happy, off = too wet).
- POSTs readings over WiFi to a FastAPI backend, which stores them in
  PostgreSQL. (Backend currently runs on a laptop on the LAN; will move
  to a cloud VM later.)
- Web dashboard at `/` — one card per plant with current status. Click a
  plant for a Chart.js graph of moisture over time, plus per-type care
  info (description + watering habits) joined from a `plant_types` table.
- Add new plants from the web (`/plants/new`) — the form autocompletes
  plant type from existing entries via an HTML5 `<datalist>`.
- *Planned:* Per-plant thresholds fetched by the chip on boot, so each
  plant's LED reflects values appropriate for that species (a succulent
  and a fern have very different "happy" ranges).
- *Planned:* AI-generated care info when a new `plant_type` is added,
  via the Claude API.

## Hardware

- ESP32-C3 Super Mini running MicroPython v1.28.0
- Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2 — powered from 3.3V, AOUT on GPIO 3
- RGBW LED strip driven through NPN transistors (red = GPIO 4, green = GPIO 10;
  blue and white not yet wired)

## Repo layout

- `firmware/` — MicroPython code that runs on the ESP32
- `backend/` — FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend that receives readings and serves the dashboard
  - `app.py` — routes (POST readings, home grid, plant detail, add-plant form)
  - `templates/` — Jinja templates (`base.html`, `home.html`, `plant_detail.html`, `plant_new.html`)
  - `static/css/custom.css` — theme overrides for Pico

## Backend stack

- **FastAPI** — web framework (routes, async, auto JSON handling, form parsing via `Form(...)`)
- **Jinja2** — server-side HTML templating
- **Pico.css v2** + custom CSS variables — styling, no build step
- **Chart.js v4** + `chartjs-adapter-date-fns` — moisture chart on the detail page
- **Outfit** (Google Fonts) — display font
- **Pydantic** — request body validation
- **psycopg** (v3) — async PostgreSQL driver
- **python-multipart** — form-data parsing
- **PostgreSQL 16** — database
- **python-dotenv** — loads `.env` so credentials stay out of code

## Database schema

- `plants` — id, name, plant_type, three threshold columns, created_at
- `readings` — id, plant_id (FK), moisture_raw, recorded_at; indexed on `(plant_id, recorded_at DESC)`
- `plant_types` — name (PK), description, watering_habits, created_at — care info shared across all plants of a type

## Flashing & uploading

1. Flash MicroPython v1.28.0 for `ESP32_GENERIC_C3` once, using the
   [ESP Web Tool](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/).
2. In `firmware/`, create your local config files (both are gitignored):
   - `secrets.py` with `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD`.
   - `config.py` — copy `config.example.py` and fill in `BACKEND_URL`
     (e.g. `http://<your-laptop-LAN-IP>:8000/readings`), `PLANT_ID`, and
     `POST_EVERY_N_READS`.
3. Copy all three files to the chip:
   ```
   mpremote cp firmware/main.py :main.py
   mpremote cp firmware/secrets.py :secrets.py
   mpremote cp firmware/config.py :config.py
   ```
4. Reset the chip (`mpremote reset`) and the code runs automatically on boot.

## Status

Local pipeline complete: chip reads moisture every second, drives the LED
locally, and POSTs a reading to FastAPI every 5 minutes. Readings land in
PostgreSQL. The web dashboard is live (home grid + plant detail page with
Chart.js graph). Plants can be added via the `/plants/new` form.

Next: edit-plant form, AI-generated care info on new types, SVG plant
illustrations, watering log. Cloud deployment after the local feature
set is settled.
